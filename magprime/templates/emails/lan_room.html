You are receiving this email because you ticked an interest in <i>PC Gaming</i> (LAN) while pre-registering for MAGFest. We highly recommend bringing your own computer to fully enjoy the MAGFest LAN experience. There are public play PCs with limited availability. <b>You need prior approval from LAN staff to participate in a tournament using a public play PC.</b>
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>REMINDERS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>

Bring an ethernet cable 20 feet long or longer. We offer 20ft network cables at $5 each while quantities last. If gaming on a laptop make sure it has a wired network port. USB network adapters are $15 each while quantities last.

Don't forget your power strip. Bring headphones/mic/headset and leave your speakers at home.

<b><u>NEWS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
LAN Theater continues to innovate with a new central location and the stage makes a reappearance. Theater Spectators must pass through the LAN checkpoint. 
<br/> <br/>
We have moved the help desk closer to BYOC and added an additional Couch PC Gaming area.
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>PUBLIC COMPUTERS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
Big news this year on the Public PC front! We are excited to continue our partnership with <a href="http://www.cukusa.com)">Computer Upgrade King</a>. They are providing 80+ gaming-grade PCs for any and all attendees to enjoy over the weekend. Rest assured that if you come to enjoy the Public Play PCs then you will achieve high frame rates this year!
A huge thanks to our friends over at <a href="http://www.gexconvention.com">GEXCon</a> for helping us manage the Public PC area. Upon passing the LAN checkpoint, you will see the Public PC and LAN Theater area. The BYOC area is further back in the Maryland Ballroom.
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>LOCATION</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
This year we return to the Maryland Ballroom. We continue to offer a separate entrance and exit and we continue to use the <i>MAGLAN BarcodeSystem</i>, all for your items' security.
