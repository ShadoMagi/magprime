Hello {{ attendee.first_name }},
<br/> <br/>
As the year comes to an end the MAGFest planning kicks into overdrive. This year in LAN we have a few exciting announcements for ya.
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjW-_cQ_fyy4KaNc6Mu_cwZI-Qd0Rhv4Vy0f7PitVmo">schedule</a> for this year is now available. More information, including tournament rules and further details, will be coming soon on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magfestlan/">subreddit</a> as well as added to the previously linked schedule once they are available.</p>
<h2>PC Build Competition</h2>
Are you ready to show off your PC building skills? Do you want to see a bunch of cool builds and vote for your favorites? This year we're excited to announce the PC Build Competition!
Builds will be judged in the categories of technical achievement, artistic expression, and attendee choice. Attendees will be encouraged to have a leisurely stroll through the LAN, enjoy the blinkin' lights, and vote for the builds they like the best.
<h2>PC Rentals</h2>
Can't bring your PC to LAN? You can still join the BYOC! In partnership with with our friends at <a href="https://www.empoweredpc.com/">Empowered PC</a> we're excited to offer PC, monitor, and peripheral <a href="https://rentals.empoweredpc.com/">rentals</a>. Pick-up and drop-off will be on-site for ultimate convenience. Supplies will be limited so be sure to reserve soon.
<h2>Counter Strike is Back</h2>
