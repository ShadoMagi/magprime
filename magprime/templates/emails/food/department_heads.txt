Dear Department Heads,

Staff Suite is serving a cold menu for breakfast & lunch, as well as hot dinners provided by local caterers. Menus for each day are located on our Notion page: http://bit.ly/StaffSuite2020

ALERT! NEW POLICIES!!!

1. Allergens:
a) Catered dinners will NOT have an exhaustive list of ingredients. We are following the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 standard. We will ONLY label the "Big Eight" allergens: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.
b) All other meals will have an ingredient list. Ingredient labels will be available on our Notion page.

If you have a food allergy, please check our Notion page (http://bit.ly/StaffSuite2020), where we will have a list of foods served. During the event, it is often very busy, and staff may not have the time to look up items for you. We will also have a binder on site with lists of ingredients, but Notion is best for up-to-date allergen and ingredient information.

2. WE KILLED THE PAPER CARRYOUT SYSTEM!!!
Our wonderful software developers are testing an online ordering system so that we can put the days of paper ordering behind us. More details to come! GET HYPE!

Gatorade and water reservations have been calculated by last yearâ€™s consumption. Beverages will be available for pickup, location TBD. Beverage allotments are available here: https://bit.ly/2ShOVKx
