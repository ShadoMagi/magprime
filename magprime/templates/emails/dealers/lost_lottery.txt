Good Evening!

Thank you for applying to MAGFest Marketplace this year! Unfortunately, your application did not win in the lottery, and you are not moving forward to the jury process. If you would like to still attend MAGFest as an Attendee, then you will need to pre-register for a badge through the regular pre-registration process. Thank you again for your interest, and you are welcome to apply again next year. Have a great day!
