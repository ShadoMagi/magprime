    <b>Where do I go when I arrive? How do I pick up my badge?</b><br />
    When you arrive at MAGFest, go to Registration, located in Expo Hall E, to pick up your badge. Once Registration opens on Thursday morning, usually at 10:00 AM, it will stay open until Sunday afternoon at 1:00 PM, with three exceptions. Registration will close between 4:00AM and 7:00AM Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings. Please bring a government-issued photo id such as a driver's license or military id.

<p>
    <b>Will additional badges be sold at the door?</b><br />
    Badges will be available online until we sell out, which may occur during pre-registration. Please view our website and social media for any badge availability alerts.

    <b>Which registration line do I use?</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Contractors, Staff, Volunteer, Bands, Guests, Vendors, and Indie showcase exhibitors share the same line. Look for the signage inside Expo Hall E.</li>
        <li>All other pre-registered attendees (including those who purchased group registrations) should use the "Pre-Registration Badge Pickup" line inside Expo Hall E.</li>
        <li>If you are accompanied by people who have not pre-registered, they can <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/form" target="_blank"><b>purchase one online</b></a>, as long as badges are still available.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Where can I pick up the merch that I pre-ordered?</b><br />
    After you've picked up your badge, you can pick up your swag at the front of Expo Hall E.
