Your {{ group.is_dealer|yesno(c.DEALER_REG_TERM + ",group") }} ({{ group.name }}) has been preregistered for
{{ c.EVENT_NAME }} this coming {{ event_dates() }} and your payment of {{ (group.amount_paid / 100)|format_currency }} has been received.

{% if group.unregistered_badges %}
    <br/> <br/>
    Some of your badges are not yet assigned to a specific person. If you assign these badges
    now then it will take much less time for their owners to pick them up at the event. Preassigning
    badges also allows individual members of your group to kick in extra money to upgrade their badge
    tier or order bonus items. You may preassign your badges on your
    <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}">group management page</a>.
    The individual registration links on the group management page can be filled out by you, or distributed
    to your group members for them to fill out themselves.

    <b>Your</b> registration confirmation number is {{ group.leader_id }}, and you can update your information or kick in
    {% if group.leader.amount_extra %}
    even more
    {% endif %}
    extra money <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ group.leader_id }}">here</a>.

    {% if not group.is_dealer %}
        <br/> <br/>
        You can add badges to your group using the above link, but you must add
        at least {{ c.MIN_GROUP_ADDITION }} badges at a time.
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if group.leader.requested_hotel_info and c.PREREG_REQUEST_HOTEL_INFO_OPEN %}

{% if c.CONSENT_FORM_URL and group.leader.age_group_conf['consent_form'] %}
    <br/> <br/>
    Because you are under 18, you must bring a signed and notarized parental permission
    to be granted admission to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.  You may download the consent form
    <a href="{{ c.CONSENT_FORM_URL }}">by clicking here</a>.
    <br/> <br/>
    You may <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ group.leader.id }}">click here</a>
    to edit your info if you are over 18.
{% endif %}

<br/> <br/>
Badges are not mailed out before the event, so badges for your group will be available for pickup at the
registration desk when you arrive at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Inform your group to bring a photo ID and 
<a href="https://super.magfest.org/covid" target="_blank">proof of vaccination</a> to the registration
desk, where they'll be provided with their badge. If anyone in your group ordered bonus items such as a
ribbon, t-shirt, or supporter package, they can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and
hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be e-mailed prior to the event.
<br/> <br/>
You can always <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}">use this link</a> to manage your group.
