<h2> Dietary Restrictions </h2>

{% if attendee.badge_type == c.GUEST_BADGE %}
<p>We feed our guests three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and we have an easier time planning meals
when we know what kind of food restrictions everyone has.</p>
{% else %}
<p>Thank you for volunteering! We’re glad you’re here. The form below helps us better understand the dietary 
restrictions and allergies of our volunteers and staff.</p>
<p>Volunteers and staff who commit to 12 or more weighted hours are eligible to eat from Staff Suite, where 
we serve brunch and dinner.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>Brunch starts on Thursday, January 5th and meal service ends with brunch on Sunday, January 8. Staff Suite hours are from 8:00 to 12AM</p>
<p>We are returning to buffet style service, and will have grab and go items in between meals for Super 2023.</p>

<p>All ingredients for breakfast and lunch will be available on our notion page: 
<a href="http://bit.ly/StaffSuite2023" target="_blank">bit.ly/StaffSuite2023</a>. Dinners are catered 
by outside restaurants, so we can only provide details on the Big Eight food allergens: <strong>Milk, eggs, fish, 
shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soy</strong>. If you have dietary restrictions outside of the Big Eight, 
we recommend you consider alternate options for dinners.</p>

<p><strong>We have open containers of peanut butter in Staff Suite.</strong></p>

<form method="post" action="food_restrictions">
    {{ csrf_token() }}
    <input type="hidden" name="id" value="{{ fr.db_id }}" />

    Please select any options that apply:<br/>
    <div id="restrictions">{{ macros.checkgroup(fr, 'standard') }}</div>

    <br/>
    Let us know if you have any other allergies or restrictions. Please use commas to separate each allergy and food restriction. 
    Please note we are unable to accommodate every constraint, and the form below is not designed for preferences due to taste. 
    Menus and ingredients will be posted before Super MAGFest 2023 on our Notion page:
     <a href="http://bit.ly/StaffSuite2023" target="_blank">bit.ly/StaffSuite2023</a>
    <br/><br/>
    <textarea name="freeform" rows="3" cols="80">{{ fr.freeform }}</textarea>

    <br/> <br/> <input type="submit" value="Save" /><br/>
    By clicking Save I agree that I have read the above information and indicated any restrictions requested.
