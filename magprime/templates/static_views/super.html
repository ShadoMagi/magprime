<h1>Omega Tier</h1>

<p>
  Forget everything you’ve seen. No, wait, don’t do that, because the Omega Tier includes ALL of the previously mentioned merch, plus the absolute coolest collection of MAG Swag you’ve ever seen.
</p>

<p>
Let’s rip the band-aid off right now. Yes, that is a bodypillow-sized pillowcase with Our Beloved™ eagerly offering an egg of comfort. That’s real. You’ll get that.
</p>

<p>
Then we’ve got a full-sized tech backpack with awesome MAG space theming, a MAGCube Bento Box (which is roughly the same size as a GameCube), a limited shell to attach to your Gunship Swadge, and a bottle opener modeled after our beloved MAGTroid, “Zip”.
</p>

<p>
Plus, speaking of Zip, you’ll receive a life sized Zip plushy that doubles as a hand puppet! This custom created mascot plushy —along with all of our merch—is expertly crafted by Fangamer, so you know you can expect quality.
</p>

<p>
Note: We often sell out of this tier immediately after launch. While we’ve nearly doubled our quantity this year, we still expect to sell out rather quickly. So be sure to purchase your pre-order merch pack at the time of buying your badge!
