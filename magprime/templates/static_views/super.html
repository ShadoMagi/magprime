<h1>Maniac Tier</h1>

<p>
  Now <em>this</em> is where it gets real: Introducing the Maniac Tier. First and foremost, youâ€™ll receive EVERYTHING from the previous tiers, including the Hot Dog Swadge. 
</p>

<p>
  But that's just the beginning! The Maniac Tier also features a 3-pack of FRESH pour-over coffee from our friends at Redstart Roasters (I've already tested these, and you can make them with the Gaylord room coffee makersâ€”it's legit delicious), plus a gorgeous Emerald Coffee Tumbler so you can caffeinate in style. 
</p>

<p>
Youâ€™ll also get the Gotta-Go-Fast Socks, the high-quality Maniac Messenger Bag, a gorgeous Acrylic Character Standee, the impossible Rube Cube, and a disgustingly adorable Dr. Garbotnik ultra-soft plushy! Itâ€™s the biggest merch pack weâ€™ve ever put together and we hope you love it!
</p>

<p>
DID YOU KNOW... there's even a super secret CRAZY tier of merch, available by invite only. And the only way to score that invite is to pre-order the Maniac Tier merch... ðŸ‘€ You're going to want to act fast, though! Historically, the highest tier of merch sells out very quickly.
