<h1>Merch Me Plenty</h1>

<p>
  Now this is real shit right here. Let’s go down the list. You’ll not only receive the shirt, pin, and lanyard, but also:
<ul>
  <li><strong>GSSF: Germ Slaying Sanitization Fluid</strong> – Perfect for battling those pesky micro-demons</li>
  <li><strong>Bacterium Busting Barrier, aka the “BQ”</strong> – Finally, you’ll have the perfect way to capture and dispose of your unhallowed ooze. Use in combination with GSSF for the ultimate HP protection. (These are tissues btw)</li>
  <li><strong>Hydration Hopper</strong> – Hell is hot as hell, so load up on that good H[2O] and stay hydrated. The last thing you need is to sweat out your final bit of strength right before a Cyberdemon encounter</li>
  <li><strong>Health Kit Bag</strong> – This portable inventory system can store collected power-ups, HP drops, and even new armor. But space is limited, so choose your loadout wisely!</li>
  <li><strong>Three additional Mystery Items</strong> – Our scientists at the Deimos Aerospace Corporation (or DAC) are still trying to uncover information about these cryptic objects. Let’s just hope DAC can figure these out before it’s too late…</li>
  <li><strong>The Chainsaw Swadge</strong> – There’s only one way to slay demons, both literally and metaphorically, and that’s with a MFin’ chainsaw. But we’ll get more into the Swadge in the section below</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Now, let’s talk about this year’s Swadge. Not only does it feature a bright monochromatic OLED screen, but it has 5 
  incredible games, along with a multitude of modes and secrets. Fight through music-themed demons in our true 
  First-Person Shooter, <strong>Shredder</strong>. Maybe a shoot ‘em up is more your speed? Take a crack at the high score 
  in <strong>M-Type</strong>. And while we don’t recommend stepping on your Swadge, you can play our DDR-style silent 
  rhythm game, <strong>Stomp</strong>. If that weren’t insane enough, test your aviation and collectathon skills in our 
  Gaylord Atrium-inspired <strong>Flight Simulator</strong>, in full wireframe 3D. Finally, unwind at the end of the day 
  caring for your own personal demons, in <strong>Personal Demon</strong>, a pet raising simulator where the goal is to 
  keep your adorably-devilish creature from dying a horrible, agonizing death.
</p>

<p>
Beyond games, we have <strong>Colorchord</strong>, the ever-popular music-reactive dancing LED experience, a <strong>Universal 
Instrument Tuner</strong> (or UIT) capable of tuning any musical instrument, an adjustable <strong>Metronome</strong>, USB or 
battery power, multiple screensavers, and more <strong>Easter Eggs</strong> and features to discover for yourself! Plus, 
the software is entirely open source.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and the kick-in version of the Chainsaw Swadge is coated in <strong>ACTUAL GOLD</strong>.
