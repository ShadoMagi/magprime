<h1>T-Shirt Tier</h1>

<p>
  Nothin’ like a clean shirt halfway through a MAGFest, know what I’m saying? Especially one as gruesome and rad as this. Plus you’ll snag our hella comfortable lanyard, perfect for pin-stacking. Speaking of, you’ll get our exclusive event pin, which I’ve heard from a reliable source lets you use Onslaught for quad damage against demonic underlords.

  (This has not been scientifically confirmed, though.)
